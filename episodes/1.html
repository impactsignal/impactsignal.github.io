                    <p>The UN General Assembly voted 117-2 Thursday to establish the first-ever Independent International Scientific Panel on AI. The US and Paraguay were the only "no" votes. Secretary-General Guterres called it "a foundational step toward global scientific understanding of AI." The 40 members — selected from 2,600 candidates — will serve three-year terms starting Feb 12, 2026, issuing annual reports on AI's opportunities, risks, and impacts including humanitarian applications. Notably, the panel includes Nobel Peace laureate Maria Ressa and experts from IIT Madras, University of Minnesota, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University. The US called it "significant overreach" and warned it would "not cede authority over AI to international bodies."</p>

                    <p>New Delhi hosts the AI Impact Summit starting Monday — the largest global AI summit ever held in the Global South. PM Modi and French President Macron will inaugurate on Feb 19. The UN will convene 30+ side events covering disaster risk reduction, health systems, agriculture, food security, and children's safety. Kamal Kishore, the Secretary-General's Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction, will participate. India will showcase AIKosh — a UPI-like public AI platform hosting 5,500+ datasets and 251 AI models across 20 sectors including agriculture, health, and climate. Seven focus areas include "Resilience, Innovation and Efficiency" — exploring AI for disaster response and infrastructure. Attendees include Sam Altman, Sundar Pichai, Bill Gates, and heads of UNDP, UNICEF, and UNESCO. Registration is free.</p>

                    <h3>4. IRC's 2026 Emergency Watchlist: "New World Disorder" as Aid Collapses</h3>
                    <p>The International Rescue Committee released its 2026 Emergency Watchlist warning of a dangerous divergence: humanitarian needs surging while global support collapses. Key findings: more active wars than any point since WWII (1 in 7 people globally threatened by armed conflict); 83% of USAID programs cancelled since March 2025; 37 million people at emergency-level food insecurity (highest since 2021); 117.3 million forcibly displaced. A Lancet study estimates 1.8 million additional deaths in 2025 from aid cuts, potentially 14 million preventable deaths by 2030. This underscores the urgency for AI-enabled efficiency in humanitarian operations as budgets collapse.</p>

                    <p>Today's LA Times reports hospitals in Yemen struggling to obtain basic supplies as DOGE cuts to US aid programs take effect. Nearly 20 million Yemenis require humanitarian assistance; 9.6 million women and girls face severe hunger and a collapsing health system. This is a live case study for why AI-powered supply chain optimization and predictive health analytics matter — when budgets shrink, technology must stretch remaining resources further.</p>

                    <p>Released Feb 3 ahead of the India summit, the second International AI Safety Report — the largest global collaboration on AI safety to date — warns of expanding AI capabilities and uneven risk management. Prepared by 100+ independent experts via Carnegie Endowment, it provides evidence-based assessment of how AI advances translate into real-world risks. Key for humanitarian practitioners: guidance on deploying AI responsibly in high-stakes environments where failures cost lives.</p>

                    <p>Published today: UNDRR reports Ethiopia and South Sudan sent delegations to learn from Mozambique's modernized National Multi-Hazard Early Warning Situation Room (inaugurated Sept 2025). The AMHEWAS network — designed to increase availability of multi-hazard early warning systems across Africa — is expanding. Both countries plan national situation rooms. DRC launched its own "Early Warnings for All" (EW4All) initiative on Jan 28. These multi-hazard warning systems increasingly incorporate AI-driven climate modeling and satellite data analysis for flood/drought/cyclone prediction.</p>

                    <p>A new AI model from the University of Michigan can interpret brain MRIs in seconds, detecting neurological conditions with up to 97.5% accuracy and predicting urgency of care needed. This matters for humanitarian contexts where radiologists are scarce — the model could be deployed in field hospitals and under-resourced clinics. The tool addresses a critical access gap as demand for neurological care outstrips specialist availability globally.</p>
