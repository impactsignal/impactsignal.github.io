🔴 Disaster Response 🟢 Climate Resilience 🟣 Innovation 🟠 Humanitarian AI Episode 2 February 14, 2026 AI Drones Turning Wars on Civilians, World's First Wildfire Early Action Protocol, Google Expands Flood Forecasting Across Africa AI for Impact Daily Briefing — February 14, 2026 🎧 6:22 Listen on: Spotify Apple Podcasts YouTube Substack RSS 🔥 Top Stories 1. ICRC Chief Warns AI &amp; Drones Turning Wars Into Wars on Civilians ICRC President Mirjana Spoljaric told the Munich Security Conference that conflicts have doubled in 15 years and quadrupled in 30, with AI and drone technology "amplifying the negative impacts on civilians." She stated: "There's never a moment where drones fight against drones. Drones fight against the military and increasingly against civilians." She called on world leaders to adopt a protective interpretation of international humanitarian law rather than a permissive one.

IFRC Activates World's First Wildfire Early Action Protocol in Chile The IFRC operationalized its "Simplified Early Action Protocol" for wildfires in Chile — a global first. Predictive meteorological models tracking Puelche winds triggered the automatic release of 95,000 CHF to help 2,000 people before fires reached peak intensity. An additional 500,000 CHF from the DREF supported evacuation of 50,000 people. This is forecast-based financing in action: algorithms release money before the disaster, not after.

### #1: AI for Social Impact — UN AI Panel, India Summit, and Why Aid Is Collapsing
URL: https://impactsignals.ai/episodes/1-un-ai-panel-india-summit-aid-collapsing/

🔵 Policy &amp; Governance 🟠 Humanitarian AI 🟢 Climate Resilience 🟣 Innovation Episode 1 February 13, 2026 The UN's New AI Panel, India's AI Summit, and Why Aid Is Collapsing AI for Impact Daily Briefing — February 13, 2026 🎧 4:03 Listen on: Spotify Apple Podcasts YouTube Substack RSS 🔥 Top Stories 1. UN General Assembly Approves 40-Member AI Scientific Panel Over US Objections The UN General Assembly voted 117-2 Thursday to establish the first-ever Independent International Scientific Panel on AI. The US and Paraguay were the only "no" votes. Secretary-General Guterres called it "a foundational step toward global scientific understanding of AI." The 40 members — selected from 2,600 candidates — will serve three-year terms starting Feb 12, 2026, issuing annual reports on AI's opportunities, risks, and impacts including humanitarian applications. Notably, the panel includes Nobel Peace laureate Maria Ressa and experts from IIT Madras, University of Minnesota, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University. The US called it "significant overreach" and warned it would "not cede authority over AI to international bodies." Framework tags: Resilience, Enablement &nbsp;|&nbsp; Sources: AP via Yahoo News, China Daily, US News 2. India AI Impact Summit: First Global South AI Summit Opens Feb 16-20 with Disaster Resilience Track New Delhi hosts the AI Impact Summit starting Monday — the largest global AI summit ever held in the Global South. PM Modi and French President Macron will inaugurate on Feb 19. The UN will convene 30+ side events covering disaster risk reduction, health systems, agriculture, food security, and children's safety. Kamal Kishore, the Secretary-General's Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction, will participate. India will showcase AIKosh — a UPI-like public AI platform hosting 5,500+ datasets and 251 AI models across 20 sectors including agriculture, health, and climate. Seven focus areas include "Resilience, Innovation and Efficiency" — exploring AI for disaster response and infrastructure.

Framework tags: Resilience, Enablement, Co-Creation &nbsp;|&nbsp; Sources: Tribune India, Times of India, NDTV, Business Outreach 3. Tata AI Sakhi: Empowering Rural Women Through Hands-On AI at India Summit Tata Group is launching the "AI Sakhi Immersion Program" at the India AI Impact Summit — a social-impact initiative designed to empower rural women through hands-on AI learning and real-world skill building. Targeting women entrepreneurs, artisans, and community leaders, the program helps participants explore how AI can improve productivity and unlock new opportunities in everyday life and business. Session on "Social Empowerment via AI Accessibility" scheduled Feb 17 at Bharat Mandapam. Framework tags: Enablement, Co-Creation &nbsp;|&nbsp; Sources: Business Today, X/@stpiindia 4. IRC's 2026 Emergency Watchlist: "New World Disorder" as Aid Collapses The International Rescue Committee released its 2026 Emergency Watchlist warning of a dangerous divergence: humanitarian needs surging while global support collapses. Key findings: more active wars than any point since WWII (1 in 7 people globally threatened by armed conflict); 83% of USAID programs cancelled since March 2025; 37 million people at emergency-level food insecurity (highest since 2021); 117.3 million forcibly displaced. A Lancet study estimates 1.8 million additional deaths in 2025 from aid cuts, potentially 14 million preventable deaths by 2030. This underscores the urgency for AI-enabled efficiency in humanitarian operations as budgets collapse. Framework tags: Response, Relief, Resilience &nbsp;|&nbsp; Sources: IRC Emergency Watchlist, Rescue.org 5. Yemen Health System Buckles Under USAID Cuts — The Human Cost of Aid Collapse Today's LA Times reports hospitals in Yemen struggling to obtain basic supplies as DOGE cuts to US aid programs take effect. Nearly 20 million Yemenis require humanitarian assistance; 9.6 million women and girls face severe hunger and a collapsing health system. This is a live case study for why AI-powered supply chain optimization and predictive health analytics matter — when budgets shrink, technology must stretch remaining resources further. Framework tags: Response, Relief &nbsp;|&nbsp; Sources: LA Times, UNFPA, OCHA 6. International AI Safety Report 2026: Systemic Resilience as Central Challenge Released Feb 3 ahead of the India summit, the second International AI Safety Report — the largest global collaboration on AI safety to date — warns of expanding AI capabilities and uneven risk management. Prepared by 100+ independent experts via Carnegie Endowment, it provides evidence-based assessment of how AI advances translate into real-world risks. Key for humanitarian practitioners: guidance on deploying AI responsibly in high-stakes environments where failures cost lives. Framework tags: Resilience, Enablement &nbsp;|&nbsp; Sources: Carnegie Endowment, Inside Privacy, CADE 7. Africa Multi-Hazard Early Warning Systems Expand: Mozambique Teaches Ethiopia &amp; South Sudan Published today: UNDRR reports Ethiopia and South Sudan sent delegations to learn from Mozambique's modernized National Multi-Hazard Early Warning Situation Room (inaugurated Sept 2025). The AMHEWAS network — designed to increase availability of multi-hazard early warning systems across Africa — is expanding. Both countries plan national situation rooms. DRC launched its own "Early Warnings for All" (EW4All) initiative on Jan 28. These multi-hazard warning systems increasingly incorporate AI-driven climate modeling and satellite data analysis for flood/drought/cyclone prediction. Framework tags: Resilience, Compounding Innovation &nbsp;|&nbsp; Sources: ReliefWeb, UNDRR 8. University of Michigan AI Reads Brain MRIs in Seconds — 97.5% Accuracy A new AI model from the University of Michigan can interpret brain MRIs in seconds, detecting neurological conditions with up to 97.5% accuracy and predicting urgency of care needed. This matters for humanitarian contexts where radiologists are scarce — the model could be deployed in field hospitals and under-resourced clinics. The tool addresses a critical access gap as demand for neurological care outstrips specialist availability globally.
