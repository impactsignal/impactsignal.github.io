### Top Stories

**1. ICRC Chief Warns AI & Drones Turning Wars Into Wars on Civilians**
Tags: Resilience, Enablement | Sources: Digital Journal, RTL

ICRC President Mirjana Spoljaric told the Munich Security Conference that conflicts have doubled in 15 years and quadrupled in 30, with AI and drone technology "amplifying the negative impacts on civilians." She stated: "There's never a moment where drones fight against drones. Drones fight against the military and increasingly against civilians." She called on world leaders to adopt a protective interpretation of international humanitarian law rather than a permissive one.

**2. IFRC Activates World's First Wildfire Early Action Protocol in Chile**
Tags: Response, Relief, Compounding Innovation | Sources: IFRC, FundsforNGOs

The IFRC operationalized its "Simplified Early Action Protocol" for wildfires in Chile — a global first. Predictive meteorological models tracking Puelche winds triggered the automatic release of 95,000 CHF to help 2,000 people before fires reached peak intensity. An additional 500,000 CHF from the DREF supported evacuation of 50,000 people. This is forecast-based financing in action: algorithms release money before the disaster, not after.

**3. Google Expands AI Flood Forecasting Across Africa, Partners with AU**
Tags: Resilience, Compounding Innovation | Sources: Google Blog, Salesforce/GiveDirectly case study

Google expanded its AI-powered Flood Hub to new regions in Nigeria and Ethiopia, partnering with GiveDirectly and the African Union Commission. In Nigeria, Google's forecasts enabled GiveDirectly to deliver pre-disaster cash transfers before floodwaters rose. Google also highlighted FireSat, its satellite constellation using AI to detect wildfires as small as 5×5 meters with a 20-minute revisit rate.

**4. WHO Launches AI-Powered Emergency Response Toolkit (AIM)**
Tags: Response, Enablement | Sources: WHO

The WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean launched the All-Hazard Information Management (AIM) Toolkit, a generative AI system that compresses emergency response document production from weeks to minutes. The chronic administrative bottleneck in humanitarian response — writing sitreps, needs assessments, and appeals — now has an AI solution in production at WHO.

**5. Caltech Unveils X1: Multi-Modal Search-and-Rescue Robot**
Tags: Response, Compounding Innovation | Sources: Futura Sciences, Sparc AI

Researchers from Caltech, Northeastern University, and TII unveiled the X1 — a hybrid humanoid-drone SAR robot that autonomously switches between walking, flying, and driving based on terrain. Using sensor fusion (lidar + cameras), it decides its locomotion mode without human input. Separately, Sparc AI released Overwatch for GPS-denied drone navigation.

**6. University of Twente: AI + Drone Simulation Tested on Six Historical Disasters**
Tags: Relief, Recovery, Compounding Innovation | Sources: University of Twente

A new study developed an AI-powered simulation model for drone-integrated humanitarian logistics, tested against six historical disasters. Smart algorithms determine which vehicle (truck, helicopter, drone) should serve which location, optimizing for cost, speed, risk, and reduction of human suffering.

**7. Salesforce Agentforce Powers Good360's Disaster Relief Matching**
Tags: Relief, Recovery, Enablement | Sources: Salesforce Blog

Good360 used an AI agent during the LA wildfires that matched donated products to nonprofit needs, reducing matching time from 30 min to 10 min. The agent proactively suggested items the team hadn't considered (e.g., workboots for first responders). Operational AI in real disaster response.

**8. AI Heatwave Early Warning for Gulf Region — Khalifa University Study**
Tags: Resilience, Enablement | Sources: The National

A Khalifa University study analyzed the 2024 Makkah heatwave (51.8°C, 1,300+ Hajj pilgrim deaths) and found AI-based forecasting can predict extreme heat events days in advance. Heatwaves in the Middle East are now 2× more frequent. Even 48 hours of warning at mass gatherings could save hundreds of lives.

Tags: Resilience, Enablement | Sources: AP via Yahoo News, China Daily, US News

The UN General Assembly voted 117-2 Thursday to establish the first-ever Independent International Scientific Panel on AI. The US and Paraguay were the only "no" votes. Secretary-General Guterres called it "a foundational step toward global scientific understanding of AI." The 40 members — selected from 2,600 candidates — will serve three-year terms starting Feb 12, 2026, issuing annual reports on AI's opportunities, risks, and impacts including humanitarian applications. Notably, the panel includes Nobel Peace laureate Maria Ressa and experts from IIT Madras, University of Minnesota, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University. The US called it "significant overreach" and warned it would "not cede authority over AI to international bodies."
