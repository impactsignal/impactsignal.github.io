      <title>#4: AI for Social Good — India Summit, Legal Gaps in Disaster AI, 1.1B Hunger Crisis</title>
      <description>AI for social impact daily briefing — Impact Signals covers how artificial intelligence is transforming disaster response, humanitarian aid, and social good.

AI for social impact daily briefing — Impact Signals covers how artificial intelligence is transforming disaster response, humanitarian aid, and social good. Today: India AI Impact Summit opens as the first major AI summit in the Global South, UNDRR warns legal gaps block AI disaster response, and an AI model predicts 1.1 billion could face hunger by 2100.

TOP STORIES

1. India AI Impact Summit Opens — 250,000 Expected at First Global South AI Summit
PM Modi inaugurated the five-day summit at Bharat Mandapam, New Delhi. 20 national leaders, 45 ministerial delegations, tech CEOs from Google, NVIDIA, Microsoft, OpenAI. India positions "Digital Public Infrastructure" as AI-as-public-utility model.

2. UNDRR: AI Disaster Apps Useless Without Legal Framework
UNDRR's Sujit Mohanty: district magistrates cannot legally rely on AI predictions for evacuations. Global disaster losses ~$200B annually. Calls for regulatory scaffolding alongside technology deployment.

3. AI Model: Climate Change Could Push 1.1 Billion Into Hunger by 2100
Nature Scientific Reports study using only temperature/precipitation data. 600M+ children at risk. Africa: 170M face starvation in 2099. Minimal-data approach makes it deployable in data-scarce humanitarian regions.

4. India Launches SAHI &amp; BODH Healthcare AI Frameworks
National AI healthcare strategy plus open benchmarking platform for health AI models. BODH fills critical gap for transparent model comparison in low-resource settings.

5. Nonprofit AI Report: 92% Adopt, Only 7% See Impact
346-org study. 81% use AI individually without shared workflows. 47% no governance. Real impact requires workflow redesign, not just tool adoption.

6. Kerala AI Disaster Preparedness Roadmap
AI heat stress predictions, mobile-first emergency alerts from 2018 flood lessons. Transferable to climate-vulnerable regions globally.

7. China: AI Security = National Disaster Category
First nation to classify AI incidents alongside earthquakes in emergency response plans.

8. UN Women + Bioniks: AI Prosthetics in Pakistan
AI-powered prosthetic limbs for rural women at dramatically lower costs. Homegrown Global South AI innovation.

UPCOMING: India AI Summit (Feb 16-20, New Delhi). ITU AI for Good (Feb 18, virtual). Stanford HAI Africa AI Leaders (Feb 25). Code4Sudan Hackathon (through Feb 28). AAAI AI+HADR Symposium (Apr 7-9, Burlingame).

ACTIVE MONITORING: Madagascar Cyclone Gezani — 59+ dead, 400K in need. East Africa drought — 4.6M affected. Sudan conflict — 862K reached by Human Appeal. South Sudan — 280K displaced. Haiti displacement ongoing.
