      <description>Impact Signals #2: AI Drones Turning Wars on Civilians, World's First Wildfire Early Action Protocol, Google Expands Flood Forecasting Across Africa

AI for Impact Daily Briefing — February 14, 2026

The ICRC president warns at Munich Security Conference that AI-powered drones are turning wars into wars on civilians. Meanwhile, the IFRC activates the world's first AI-driven wildfire Early Action Protocol in Chile — forecast-based financing that released funds automatically before fires hit peak intensity. Google expands flood forecasting across Africa with the AU, WHO launches an AI emergency response toolkit, and Caltech unveils a multi-modal search-and-rescue robot.

TOP STORIES

1. ICRC Chief Warns AI &amp; Drones Turning Wars on Civilians — ICRC President Spoljaric at Munich Security Conference: "There's never a moment where drones fight against drones." Calls for protective interpretation of international humanitarian law.

2. IFRC Activates World's First Wildfire Early Action Protocol in Chile — Predictive models triggered automatic release of 95,000 CHF to help 2,000 people before fires peaked. Additional 500,000 CHF supported evacuation of 50,000.

3. Google Expands AI Flood Forecasting Across Africa — Flood Hub expands to Nigeria and Ethiopia. GiveDirectly delivers pre-disaster cash transfers based on AI predictions. AU Commission partnership signals continental scale.

4. WHO Launches AI-Powered Emergency Response Toolkit (AIM) — Generative AI compresses emergency response documents from weeks to minutes. Now in production.

5. Caltech Unveils X1: Multi-Modal SAR Robot — Hybrid humanoid-drone that walks, flies, and drives autonomously. GPS-denied drone navigation also released by Sparc AI.

6. University of Twente: AI + Drone Logistics Simulation — Tested on six historical disasters. Optimizes for cost, speed, risk, and suffering reduction simultaneously.

7. Salesforce Agentforce Powers Good360 Disaster Relief Matching — AI cut donation-matching time from 30 to 10 minutes during LA wildfires.

8. AI Heatwave Early Warning for Gulf Region — Khalifa University study on 2024 Makkah heatwave (1,300+ deaths). AI can predict extreme heat days in advance.

UPCOMING: India AI Impact Summit (Feb 16-20, New Delhi) — first Global South AI summit. IBM Impact Accelerator applications open through March 25. AAAI AI+HADR Symposium April 7-9.

ACTIVE MONITORING: Vanuatu M6.4 earthquake (Feb 14). Colombia flooding — HNRP 2026 launched. South Sudan Jonglei conflict — 280K displaced. Syria ongoing response. Haiti displacement from Port-au-Prince attacks.
